# 🏷️ Shift vs Shift Template View

*Matt Law | Last Updated: {{date}}*

This document describes the Shift vs Shift Template View — a reporting window used to compare actual rostered shifts against the expected shift template, particularly for Supported Independent Living (SIL) services.

---

### 📚 Description
The Shift vs Shift Template View is a read-only in-window report designed to highlight variances between rostered shifts and the defined shift template.  
It provides maximum visibility with a wide range of fields to support various analysis needs, including staffing, timing, frequency, and location gaps.

This view is not intended for single-record review. It is designed to be used in **grid toggle view**, where rows can be filtered, grouped, and compared efficiently.

---

### 🧭 Navigation
- Access via: Main menu => Shift vs Shift Template View
- Or: Home Screen activity tile (if configured as part of a compliance or rostering queue)

---

### 🛠️ Functionality
- Displays actual shifts alongside template details in a flattened, read-only format
- Compares key dimensions:
  - Day, Time, Staff Assigned
  - Location, Activity
- Designed to assist with:
  - Detecting shift pattern deviations
  - Confirming SIL staffing levels
  - Validating roster compliance
- Can be filtered by:
  - Date range
  - Location
  - Activity
  - Staff assigned
- Can be exported (typically from a report) or used with saved queries for ongoing audits

---

### 🎯 Tips
- Always use **Grid Toggle View** — this report is designed for side-by-side comparison, not single-record inspection
- Create **column views** tailored to the analysis you're doing.
- Save your filters and column layouts for repeatable use
- Consider pairing this view with a QuickInfo panel for additional insight (e.g., credential status, last shift notes)

---

### 📝 Notes
- The view may appear overwhelming if all fields are shown — always reduce columns for readability
- Particularly useful for SIL but can support broader shift consistency analysis
