# 🏷️ Document Types

*Matt Law | Last Updated: 2025-05-07*

This document defines how to maintain the **Document Types** lookup, used to categorise records in the *Consents and Legal Orders* tab for Support Receivers.

---

### 📚 Description
The **Document Types** window provides a basic dropdown list of document categories (e.g., Consent, Legal Order).  
It is referenced in the **Consents and Legal Orders** tab to group and distinguish between legal or compliance documents.

---

### 🧭 Navigation
- Access via: **Main Menu** → search **"Document Types"**
- Used in: *Consents and Legal Orders* tab on **Support Receiver (BP)**

---

### 🛠️ Functionality

#### Key Fields
- **Search Key**: Short code or identifier (e.g., CONSENT, ORDER).
- **Name**: Displayed name (e.g., Consent).
- **Description**: Optional explanatory text.

---

### 🎯 Tips
- Keep names short and user-friendly.
- Use consistent naming to match compliance documentation (e.g., “Consent” not “Agreement”).
- If a new legal form is introduced, consider whether a new document type is required.

---

### 📝 Notes
- Table: `AbERP_Document_Type`
- Only active document types appear in the dropdown on related windows.
