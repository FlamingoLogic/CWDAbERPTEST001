# 🏷️ Group Type

*Matt Law | Last Updated: 2025-05-15*

The **Group Type** window is a simple lookup tool used to define standard categories for group sessions in AbilityERP. It allows users to tag each Group Session with a consistent label for filtering, reporting, and operational clarity.

---

## 📚 Description

This lookup supports operational classification of group-based activities such as day trips, in-house events, or programs. It is used solely for display, search, or reporting — **not for financial or compliance logic**.

---

## 🧭 Navigation

- Access via: **Main Menu → Group Type**
- Referenced by: [Group Sessions](Group-Sessions.md)

---

## 🪟 Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Search Key** | Unique short code (e.g., `DAY`, `EXCUR`, `COMM`). |
| **Name** | Human-readable name (e.g., "Day Trip", "Excursion"). |
| **Description** | Optional notes about the group type usage or context. |

---

## 🎯 Tips

- Keep the **Search Key** short and consistent (3–6 uppercase letters).
- Use **Name** for clarity in user-facing screens.
- Can be updated or deactivated at any time; not tied to accounting or validations.
