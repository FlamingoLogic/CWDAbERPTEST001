# üè∑Ô∏è Recurring

*Matt Law | Last Updated: 2025-05-01*

This document outlines how to use the Recurring tool in AbilityERP ‚Äî used to automate the periodic creation of documents like invoices, journals, and bookings.

---

## üìö Description  
The Recurring tool in AbilityERP enables periodic generation of documents like Invoices, GL Journals, Payments, Receipts, Orders, and Projects, improving automation and consistency.

---

## üß≠ Navigation  
- Access via: AbilityERP => Recurring window.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Functionality  
- Create recurring documents by linking to a source document (e.g., Invoice, GL Journal).
- Set recurring parameters, including Recurring Type, Maximum Runs, and Date Next Run.
- Generate the first recurring document using the Start Process button.
- Achieve every other week / month by using the Frequency field.  
  Note recurring is generally a well used function, above [Templating](Templating.md) for most use cases for allowed recurring types.
- Add to a [Recurring-Run](Recurring-Run.md) for batch processing.

---

## üéØ Tips  
- Ensure the source document is at least prepared for it to be selected for recurring though avoid leaving prepared documents uncompleted to prevent errors. Create and complete the source document, then reverse it, or prepare it with notes indicating it‚Äôs for recurring only.
- Use GL Journal, Invoice, Orders / Bookings, Payments or Projects to recur.
