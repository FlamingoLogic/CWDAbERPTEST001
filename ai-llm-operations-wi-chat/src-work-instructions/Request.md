# üè∑Ô∏è Request

*Matt Law | Last Updated: 2025-05-01*

The **Request** window is the primary tool in AbilityERP for managing internal tasks, approvals, and queue-based workflows. It offers flexible workflows, robust visibility, and powerful referencing without rigid structures‚Äîdesigned to replace email and unify organisational task management.

## üìö Description

Requests in AbilityERP enable users to capture, assign, and progress work in a consistent and referenceable way. Whether manual or automated, every task can be documented, tracked, and audited using this tool.
