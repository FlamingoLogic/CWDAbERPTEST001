# 🏷️ Animal Type

*Matt Law | Last Updated: 2025-05-07*

This document outlines the use of the **Animal Type** lookup window in AbilityERP.  
This window provides a central list of animal types for use in participant-linked [animal](animal.md) records.

---

### 📚 Description
The **Animal Type** window defines values for the dropdown field in the **Animal** tab of the Support Receiver window. It ensures consistent classification of pets or support animals across records.

---

### 🧭 Navigation
- Access via: **Main Menu** → search **"Animal Type"**

---

### 🛠️ Functionality

#### Key Fields
- **Search Key**: Short code (e.g., DOG, CAT).
- **Name**: Display label (e.g., Dog, Cat, Bird).
- **Description**: Optional extra detail.

---

### 🎯 Tips
- Keep names short and clear — typically species or common labels.
- Only include active types to avoid clutter in dropdowns.
- Avoid duplication by using consistent naming rules (e.g., singular terms like “Dog” not “Dogs”).

---

### 📝 Notes
- Table: `AbERP_AnimalType`
- This is a simple reference table and can be centrally maintained.
