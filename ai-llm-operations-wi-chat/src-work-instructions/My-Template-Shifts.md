# 🏷️ My Template Shifts

*Matt Law | Last Updated: 2025-05-15*

The **My Template Shifts** window allows employees to review standardised shifts assigned to them within a shift template cycle. It is a mobile-friendly view tied to the **Shift (Rostered) Template → Employee tab**, optimised for regular shift patterns in a fortnightly cycle.

---

## 📚 Description

This view displays employee-linked template shifts — the pre-configured pattern of work that will later generate actual shifts. It helps support workers understand their standard expected shifts without needing full admin access.

This window is **read-only** and automatically filtered to show template shifts where the current user is the assigned employee.

---

## 🧭 Navigation

- Access via: **Main Menu → My Template Shifts**
- Auto-filters by: `Employee (User)` = current user

---

## 🪟 Fields Displayed

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Employee (User) / Agency Staff** | The assigned person. |
| **Start / End Day** | Day range (01–14) in the roster cycle. |
| **Start / End Time** | Shift timing window. |
| **Shift Type** | e.g. Direct Support, Admin. |
| **Location** | Where the shift is expected to occur. |
| **Support Receiver List** | Free text showing expected participants. |

## 🎯 Tips

- Use in tandem with [My Shifts](My-Shifts.md) to compare actual and template assignments.
- Values shown here do not change unless the shift template is updated by an authorised roster officer.
- Not editable by the employee — admin-only changes allowed in the full [Shift (Rostered) Template](Shift-(Rostered)-Template.md) window.
