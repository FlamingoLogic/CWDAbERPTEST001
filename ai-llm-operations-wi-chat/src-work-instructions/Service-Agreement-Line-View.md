# 🏷️ Service Agreement Line View

*Matt Law | Last Updated: 2025-05-01*

This document outlines how to use the Service Agreement Line View — a reporting window used to track agreed contract amounts against booked and invoiced values for each service agreement line. It supports proactive financial oversight and helps prevent service over-delivery or under-claiming.

---

### 📚 Description
The Service Agreement Line View provides a consolidated, read-only view of each participant’s service agreement lines, comparing:
- **Planned (agreed) amount**
- **Invoiced amount**
- **Open booking amount** _(amount on a booking not yet invoiced)_
- **Remaining available funds**

The view is particularly useful for:
- Detecting potential overservicing before it occurs
- Monitoring invoicing progress across multiple programs
- Ensuring bookings and claims align with agreed NDIS budgets

This report is designed for **grid toggle view**, not single-record inspection.

---

### 🧭 Navigation
- Access via: Main menu => Service Agreement Line View
- Or: Home Screen document status indicator if configured

---

### 🛠️ Functionality
- Read-only in-window report combining:
  - Service agreement line metadata (e.g., Contract Dates, Project Line)
  - Financials: Planned price, Invoiced amount, Open booking amount
  - Derived metrics: Planned less Invoiced, Planned less Invoiced less Open Booking
- Filters by:
  - Participant (SA Search)
  - Project Line / Program
  - Dates
- Designed to assist roles in finance, compliance, and service delivery coordination
- Supports report and export, saved queries, and custom column views

---

### 🎯 Tips
- Always use **Grid Toggle View** for analysis
- Create and save **column layouts** to avoid overload from excessive fields
- Focus on the **“Planned less Invoiced less Open Booking”** column to spot risks
- Use filters to monitor high-risk clients or high-volume programs (e.g., SIL, Day Options)
