# 🏷️ My Shifts

*Matt Law | Last Updated: 2025-05-15*

The **My Shifts** window is a streamlined, mobile-friendly view designed for support staff to check their assigned shifts. It pulls from the **Shift (Rostered)** → Employee tab, showing only relevant fields for on-the-go users.

---

## 📚 Description

This read-only view displays shifts linked to the currently logged-in staff member (internal or agency). It is optimised for quick access via phone or tablet, typically accessed through a role-based menu.

---

## 🧭 Navigation

- Access via: **Main Menu → My Shifts**
- Filters automatically by: `Employee (User)` = current logged-in user
- Often opened from homescreen DSI's like 'my shifts this fortnight'.

## 🪟 Fields Displayed

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Employee (User) / Agency Staff** | Name of the staff member (auto-filtered). |
| **Status** | Shift status (e.g. Drafted, Confirmed). |
| **Name** | Name of the shift (optional). |
| **Start / End Date** | Full time window for the shift. |
| **Support Start / End Day** | Rostered days (e.g. Monday). |
| **Duration** | Total shift hours. |

## 🎯 Tips

- Designed for **read-only** access — staff cannot edit details.
- Best used in mobile view for clean formatting.
- Works well alongside [Clock-In/Clock-Out](Shift-(Rostered).md) buttons available via full Shift view.
