# 🏷️ Service Opportunity

*Matt Law | Last Updated: 2025-05-01*

This document outlines how to use the Service Opportunity window — used to track leads that are progressing toward becoming a formal support relationship.

---

## 📚 Description  
The **Service Opportunity** window tracks leads that are progressing toward becoming a formal support relationship. It is typically created after an Enquiry is qualified, either manually or via the **AbERP Convert Enquiry** process. This window provides a structured space to manage funding conversations, priority levels, and conversion status using the Request framework.

---

## 🧭 Navigation  
- Access via: Main menu => Service Opportunity  
- Or: Created via the **AbERP Convert Enquiry** process on the [Enquiry](Enquiry.md) window.

---

## 🛠️ Functionality  
- Use the Service Opportunity to:
  - Record participant demand and services being scoped
  - Log the Opportunity Amount and estimated close date
  - Track status through configurable Request Status workflows
  - Assign responsibility via Sales Representative
  - Flag priorities and commencement requirements

The **Status** field is powered by the [Request Status](Request-Status.md) configuration, allowing flexible workflows with clear open/close behavior and sequencing.

## 🗂️ Tabs and Features

### 🧾 Main Tab  
- **Opportunity Amount** and **Probability** provide early forecasting.
- **Status** is part of a request-type workflow, allowing transitions like _Initial Consultation_ → _Pending Service Agreement_ → _Closed_.

### 📝 Activity Tab

## 🎯 Tips
