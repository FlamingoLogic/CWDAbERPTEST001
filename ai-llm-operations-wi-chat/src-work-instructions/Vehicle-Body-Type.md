# 🏷️ Vehicle Body Type

*Matt Law | Last Updated: 2025-05-02*

This document explains how to maintain the Vehicle Body Type lookup table, which is used to classify vehicles in the Vehicle window.

---

### 📚 Description
The Vehicle Body Type window allows users to define and manage a list of vehicle body classifications (e.g., Van, Sedan, SUV). These values are selected when creating or editing a vehicle record.

---

### 🧭 Navigation
- Access via: Main menu => Vehicle Body Type

---

### 🛠️ Functionality
- Add a new body type by entering a:
  - **Search Key** (short identifier)
  - **Name** (e.g., Van, Hatchback, Bus)
  - (Optional) **Description** for further context
- Used in the Vehicle window dropdown field “Vehicle Body Type”

---

### 🎯 Tips
- Use consistent naming for clarity (e.g., “Van” instead of “VAN” or “van”)
- Only include body types in active use or expected to be used soon
- Avoid duplicates or overly specific terms unless operationally required

---

### 📝 Notes *(Optional Section)*
- This is a standard lookup window with no linked transactions
- Changes here apply instantly to all users when creating/editing vehicles
