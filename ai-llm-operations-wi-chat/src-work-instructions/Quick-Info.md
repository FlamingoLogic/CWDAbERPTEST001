# 🏷️ Quick Info

*Matt Law | Last Updated: 2025-05-01*

This document outlines how to use the Quick Info feature — a dynamic sidebar tool that displays related information for the currently selected record, helping users see additional context without navigating away from their current window.

---

## 📚 Description  
**Quick Info** is a built-in iDempiere feature used to surface related details in a sidebar panel. It is available on many windows throughout AbilityERP and is especially useful in areas like Service Agreement. It provides fast visibility into relevant financial, contact, or service delivery data based on the current record.

Quick Info is **read-only** and context-aware — showing information linked to the record currently selected in the main window.

---

## 🧭 Navigation  
- Open via the **Quick Info icon** (small “?” in a circle, typically top-right of the window)

---

## 🛠️ Functionality  
- Opens a sidebar view with one or more tabs of related information
- Content varies depending on the window but may include:
  - Participant or Business Partner contact details
  - Funding or invoicing summaries
  - Outstanding actions or compliance flags
  - Linked Requests or Notes
- Can be opened/closed without refreshing the current screen
- Updates automatically when selecting a different record

---

## 🎯 Tips  
- Use Quick Info instead of opening additional tabs to keep workflows focused  
- Quick Info setup does **not require a developer** — it can be configured in _Window, Tab & Field_ via the **Quick Info Window**.
