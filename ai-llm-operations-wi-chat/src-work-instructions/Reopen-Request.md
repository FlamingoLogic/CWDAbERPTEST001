# üè∑Ô∏è Reopen Request

*Matt Law | Last Updated: 2025-05-01*

The **Reopen Request** tool in AbilityERP allows users to reopen a previously closed [Request](Request.md) record for further editing, processing, or reassignment.

---

## üìö Description

This tool is used when a request has been marked as closed but needs to be amended or reprocessed. Reopening restores the request to an editable state and resumes workflow actions.

---

## üß≠ Navigation

- Access via: Main menu => **Reopen Request** window

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Functionality

- Select the closed request using the **Request** field.
- Optionally tick **Run as Job** to process in the background (asynchronous execution).
- Executes the process to:
  - Change the request status from closed to active
  - Allow amendments or further workflow steps

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- The request **must be in a closed state** (as per its [Request-Status](Request-Status.md)) to be eligible for reopening.
- Consider whether reopening impacts downstream reporting or compliance tracking‚Äîuse audit notes if needed.
