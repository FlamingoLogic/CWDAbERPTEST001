# 🏷️ Vehicle Usage Window

*Matt Law | Last Updated: {{date}}*

This document outlines how to complete and manage records in the Vehicle Usage window, used to track transport activity including pickup/drop-off times, vehicle assignments, trip details, and support receivers (participants).

---

### 📚 Description
The Vehicle Usage window captures trip records for organisational vehicles.  
Each record documents vehicle movement, the driver or support worker involved, pick-up and drop-off details, associated participants, and service delivery references (e.g., shift or program).

This supports compliance, funding traceability, and operational reporting (e.g., KM tracking or trip frequency).

---

### 🧭 Navigation
- Access via: Main menu => Vehicle Usage

---

### 🛠️ Functionality
- **Header**:
  - Pick-up and drop-off date/time
  - Assigned vehicle and driver (Business Partner / Employee)
  - Linked shift, group session, or project line
  - Description and notes for free-text trip detail
- **Trip Details Section**:
  - Expected and actual KM travelled
  - Pick-up and drop-off locations
  - Manual override for KM if auto-entry is unavailable
- **Support Receiver Tab**:
  - List of participants (Business Partners) transported during the trip
  - Includes linked Booking, Service Agreement and Project Line
- **Status Field**:
  - Uses [[Request-Status]]

---

### 🎯 Tips
- Always complete **Pick-up Date**, **Drop-off Date**, and **Vehicle** fields
- Use **Trip Description** for a clear log of timing and route (e.g., “Pick up Jen 8:00am. Pick up David 8:30am.”)
- Ensure all transported participants are added via the **Support Receiver** tab
- Use expected KM and compare to actuals to monitor vehicle performance or route efficiency
- Link to the **Rostered Shift** or **Group Session** if relevant — this supports later reporting or cost allocation

---

### 📝 Notes *(Optional Section)*
- KM fields are split into:
  - **Expected**: Planned KM for funding/forecast
  - **Auto**: Calculated by drop off and pick up kms
  - **Manual**: For override if needed
- Each record supports audit and invoice referencing through its links to shifts and participants

---

## Enhancements
- Could add a process to convert usage records into a claim and / or validate against a booking. 
- Could include a product (to manage costs) that enables a sub-ledger for tracking and allocating vehicle-related expenses in a journal.
