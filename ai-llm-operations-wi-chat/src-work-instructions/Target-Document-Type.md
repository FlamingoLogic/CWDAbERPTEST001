# üè∑Ô∏è Target Document Type

*Matt Law | Last Updated: 2025-05-01*

This document outlines how to use and configure Target Document Types in AbilityERP ‚Äî a key setting that controls the behavior of orders, invoices, and other transactional documents.

---

## üìö Description  
Target Document Type in AbilityERP defines the document type for all accounting transaction documents, such as orders and invoices, driving their behavior, including automation, validation, and postings.

---

## üß≠ Navigation  
- Access via: Main menu => Document Type window.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Functionality  
- Sets the document type to control transaction processing (e.g., whether an order generates shipments or an invoice triggers payment upon completion).  
- Influences postings based on the document type.  
- Allows users to amend behavior by modifying document type characteristics.  
- Supports creating new document types with different base types and characteristics to meet specific needs.

---

## üìù Notes  
- Test document type behavior in a sandbox, as it affects postings and automation.  
- Document Type is not the only field impacting automations; Invoice Rule and Delivery Rule also influence transaction behavior on orders.
