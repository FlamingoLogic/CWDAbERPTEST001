# üè∑Ô∏è Request Status

*Matt Law | Last Updated: 2025-05-01*

The **Request Status** tool in AbilityERP defines the lifecycle stages of a request. It allows structured workflows‚Äîsuch as Action Sets or Approval Sets‚Äîto be built into requests, enabling automation, access control, and reporting across your organisation.

---

## üìö Description

Request Statuses group into categories (e.g., "Action Set") and define how a request progresses from open to closed. Statuses are assigned to [Request-Type](Request-Type.md) configurations and drive both automation and user access within AbilityERP.

---

## üß≠ Navigation

- Access via: **Main menu => Request Status** window  
- Or: From the **[Request](Request.md)** window via the **Status** field click-through

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Functionality

- Create **status categories** (e.g., Action Set, Approval Set)
- Control behavior using flags:
  - **Open Status** ‚Äì Editable and active
  - **Closed Status** ‚Äì Read-only, no longer displayed in [Request](Request.md)
  - **Final Close** ‚Äì Triggers processed tickbox and locks record
  - **Open and Close** or **Neither** ‚Äì For optional or transitional stages
- Use **Sequence** to define status order within the workflow
- **Timeout in Days** can automate movement to the next status (e.g., escalate after 5 days)
- Assign a **Default** status for newly created requests
- Assign statuses to windows beyond the core Request window to **customise workflows**, e.g., for [Corrective Action Requests](Best-Practices-for-Using-Requests-in-Quality-and-Safeguarding.md)

---

## üí° Tips

- Use clear, short **Search Keys** for easier filtering and automation
- Test **Timeout in Days** transitions in a sandbox before enabling in production
- Add the **Request-Type**, **Request-Status**, and **Processed** fields to windows where you want embedded request logic (very common)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Requests with **Closed Status** are only visible in [Request-(all)](Request-(all).md)
- **Web Can Update** field applies only to webstore use cases and should be ignored in standard implementations
