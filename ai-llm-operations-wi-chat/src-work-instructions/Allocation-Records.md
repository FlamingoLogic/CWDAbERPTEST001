# üõ†Ô∏è Tool: Allocation Records (AbERP_SRAllocation)

*Matt Law | Last Updated: 2025-04-30*

---

## üìò Description

The **Allocation Records** tab under the **Shift (Rostered)** window tracks the distribution of support time between Support Receivers (clients) during a shift. Each record represents a time-bound support ratio block and forms the basis for downstream allocation to bookings or invoiceable outputs.

Records are automatically generated when the shift or relevant SR timing data changes, using a hash system to detect meaningful updates. Manual record creation is disabled.

- **Main Menu** ‚Üí **Shift (Rostered)** ‚Üí Tab: **Allocation Records**

## üîß Key Fields

| Field | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| **Support Receiver** | The participant receiving support during the time block. |
| **Start Date / End Date** | The time block this ratio applies to. |
| **Duration** | Total hours of the ratio block. |
| **Part Type** | Ratio (e.g., 1:1, 1:2) applied to the time block. |
| **No. SR** | Total number of participants in this block. |
| **Shift Type** | Type of delivery (e.g., Direct Support). |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automation Rules

- Records are regenerated when a **hash change** is detected (i.e. when shift or participant times are updated).
- Button: **Regenerate Allocation Records** triggers manual regeneration.
- Hash ensures records are only recreated when allocation-relevant data changes.

## üß† Usage Tips

- Use this tab for review or audit ‚Äî most downstream use (e.g., booking validation or cost allocation) will reference these records.
- Will later support allocations against **timesheets** and **shift templates**.
