# 🏷️ Enquiry

*Matt Law | Last Updated: 2025-05-01*

This document outlines how to use the Enquiry window — a secure intake point for capturing and tracking potential new participants or clients prior to formal onboarding.

---

## 📚 Description  
The **Enquiry** window is used to capture and track potential new participants or clients prior to formal onboarding. It acts as a secure intake point—distinct from core Business Partner records—to safely manage early-stage contact details, qualification notes, and communication history. Once an enquiry is qualified, a dedicated process is available to convert it into a [(DRAFT)Business-Partner]((DRAFT)Business-Partner.md) and [Service-Opportunity](Service-Opportunity.md).

## 🧭 Navigation

## 🛠️ Functionality  
- Use this window to:
  - Record incoming expressions of interest
  - Track engagement activities (e.g. phone calls, emails)
  - Document the participant’s support needs and eligibility
  - Log outcomes and any notes from intake staff
- Select the [Enquiry Source](Enquiry-Source.md) (e.g. Phone Call, Web Form) to record the origin of the enquiry.

## 🎯 Tips  
- Think of Enquiries as unqualified leads—do not enter into the BP table until ready.
- Ensure activities and status are kept up to date to give visibility on where the lead is in the intake process.
- Use Enquiry Source consistently to support later marketing/referral analysis.
- Don’t delay conversion once the client is confirmed—this ensures proper rostering, claiming, and case note visibility.
