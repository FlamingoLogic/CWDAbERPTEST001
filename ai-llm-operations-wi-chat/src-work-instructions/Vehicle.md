# 🏷️ Vehicle Window

*Matt Law | Last Updated: {{date}}*

This document outlines how to use the Vehicle window in AbilityERP to manage organisational vehicles, including registrations, compliance, insurance, and operational tracking such as alerts and usage.

---

### 📚 Description
The Vehicle window stores all essential information about an organisational vehicle, including registration, fuel, compliance, insurance, and build specifications.  
It also links to supporting records such as invoices and vehicle usage for holistic fleet management.

---

### 🧭 Navigation
- Access via: Main menu => Vehicles
- Or: Link from requests, invoices, or usage logs referencing a specific vehicle

---

### 🛠️ Functionality
- **Core Details**:
  - Licence plate, VIN number, model, fuel type, and insurance details
  - Compliance date, registration expiry, last service, and alert configuration
  - Optional photo for vehicle identification
- **Descriptive Fields**:
  - Description and Notes support free-text context (e.g., accessibility modifications)
- **Linked Subtabs**:
  - **Alerts**: Configure service reminders, registration warnings, and mileage-based triggers
  - **Invoices**: View any invoice where the vehicle has been referenced
  - **Vehicle Usage**: See logs of when and how the vehicle has been used (e.g., for trip-based tracking)

---

### 🎯 Tips
- Use alerts to ensure timely servicing, renewals, and compliance checks
- Add “Master Location” to link vehicles to SIL locations / operational hubs
- Use the “Regular Driver” field to assign responsibility
- Vehicle Usage and Invoice tabs automatically populate if the vehicle is referenced in those transactions
- **Create a request directly on the Vehicle window** for any vehicle-related action:
  - Servicing
  - Damage reporting
  - Change of regular driver
  - Insurance or registration renewal
  - Fuel card changes
- Update the fuel card and insurance details routinely to avoid gaps in coverage

---

### 📝 Notes *(Optional Section)*
- Build and compliance details are useful for safety audits or reporting to transport authorities
- Insurance expiry and policy number fields help with fleet and risk oversight

---

### 🚀 Enhancements *(Optional Section)*
- Add QuickInfo to show last usage, outstanding alerts, and service history at a glance
- Add a Vehicle Maintenance tab for logging internal or external work orders
