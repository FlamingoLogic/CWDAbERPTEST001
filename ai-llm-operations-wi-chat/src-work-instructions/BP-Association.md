# üè∑Ô∏è BP Association

*Matt Law | Last Updated: 2025-05-07*

This document explains how to use the **BP Association** window in AbilityERP to record non-financial relationships ‚Äî especially relevant for disability and care providers managing long-term, high-trust support relationships.

---

### üìö Description  
The **BP Association** window allows users to document important social, legal, or informal relationships between a **Support Receiver (Client)** and key people in their life ‚Äî such as guardians, parents, emergency contacts, or primary contacts. Unlike financial relationships, these associations focus on duty of care and support.

This is distinct from the **Partner Relationship** window, which is used for financial or business-to-business roles (e.g., vendors, funders).

---

### üß≠ Navigation  
- Access via: Main menu ‚Üí **BP Association**
- Or: Tab on the **Support Receiver** window

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Functionality  
- **Business Partner**: The Support Receiver (e.g. David King)
- **Associated Business Partner**: The related person (e.g. Joan King)
- **Name / Description**: Human-readable reference for the relationship
- **BP Group**: The BP Group the Associated BP belongs to.
- **Relationship Type**: Multi-value field allowing combinations (e.g. Legal Guardian, Emergency Contact, Mother)
- **User/Contact**: Links to the Associated BP contact record (for alerts, communication etc.)

---

### üéØ Tips  
- Use clear naming conventions for quick recognition (e.g. "David's Mum ‚Äì Legal Guardian")
- Include legal context in the description if relevant (e.g. guardianship orders)
- Combine with request workflows or alerts if certain relationships require action (e.g. notify guardian on incident)
- Add multiple relationships per client as needed (e.g. separate contacts for medical, financial, emotional support)
- Use BP Associations instead of duplicating users across multiple Business Partners. 

---

### üìù Notes  
- Use **[[Partner-Relation]]** for billing, service provision, and funding body links.
- BP Associations do not drive financial logic but are crucial for operational visibility, compliance, and safeguarding.
- Visible in audit trails and activity logs for transparency.
