# üè∑Ô∏è Activity Viewer

*Matt Law | Last Updated: 2025-05-01*

This document outlines how to use the Activity Viewer window in AbilityERP ‚Äî a core tool for creating, viewing, and managing activities such as case notes, goal updates, and contact logs.

---

## üìö Description  
The Activity Viewer window in AbilityERP (and core iDempiere) manages activities related to various entities, stored in the `C_ContactActivity` table. Each activity tab is associated with a specific window and has unique Activity Types tailored to that context. This tool allows users to view, create, and manage activities, with a specific process on the Support Receiver (BP) window for recurring activities. Activity Viewer is a well-used function, with key tasks including adding Support Receiver case notes and goal progress updates.
