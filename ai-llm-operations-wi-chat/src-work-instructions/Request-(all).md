# üè∑Ô∏è Request (all)

*Matt Law | Last Updated: 2025-05-01*

The **Request (all)** window provides a complete view of all requests in AbilityERP, including both open and closed items. It mirrors the functionality of the core [Request](Request.md) window but without status-based filtering.

---

## üìö Description

Use this tool when you need historical access or visibility across all requests, regardless of status. It is especially useful for reporting, audits, and reviewing long-term activity across departments.

---

## üß≠ Navigation

- Access via: **AbilityERP => Request (all)** window

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Functionality

- Displays **all requests**, including closed, in a single view
- Supports all standard filtering (e.g. category, type, assignee, status)
- Used for audit and review processes that extend beyond active task management
- Enables navigation to individual request records with full history and update trail

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- This window does not restrict by [Request-Status](Request-Status.md), so use filters
