# 🏷️ Advanced Search – Orders

*Matt Law | Last Updated: {{date}}*

This document defines the Advanced Search – Orders tool functionality, navigation, and purpose within AbilityERP.  
It supports queue-based workflows by exposing both order and booking headers and lines in a single, read-only table window.

---

### 📚 Description
The Advanced Search – Orders tool simplifies visibility and filtering of order and booking data by combining header and line-level information into a single searchable view.  
This eliminates the need to navigate between separate windows or subtabs, significantly improving usability in high-volume workflows.

---

### 🧭 Navigation
- Access via: Main menu => “Advanced Search – Orders”
- Or: Open from activity on the Home Screen or by link from related workflow dashboards

---

### 🛠️ Functionality
- Combines Order/Booking Header and Line data into a single view (flattened structure)
- Read-only: records cannot be edited from this view
- Clicking on the Order field opens the full transaction in its original window
- Supports queue-based workflows (e.g. ready-to-claim checks)
- Enables fast searching across line-level fields without tab navigation

---

### 🎯 Tips
- Ideal for identifying unclaimed bookings, line gaps, or orders requiring action
- Include this tool in dashboards or document status indicators to drive workflow steps
- Create saved queries based on the flags on the order heading / lines. 

---

### 🚀 Enhancements
